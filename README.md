QSystem In Person Queue Management System.

We are experimenting with this open-source queue management system with the hope of adapting to fit Service BC's needs.

Current top issues for us are: the code comments, config and XML files are in Russian, the native language of the original authors.  We are slowly making our way through it and making heavy use of Google Translate as we go.  If you see anything of interest or concern, please let us know.
